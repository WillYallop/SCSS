# SCSS

This is a starting point SCSS setup for any and all projects. 

It only includes helper classes, style resets and it uses the BEM methodology to increase reusability and decrease file sizes. On top of this, a small, but obvious realisation I made, was how much weight class names can have on the final build: it isn't massive, but also not negligible. So because of this, all the helper classes follow a very minimal, but hopefully straightforward naming scheme, listing just the first character of each word.
